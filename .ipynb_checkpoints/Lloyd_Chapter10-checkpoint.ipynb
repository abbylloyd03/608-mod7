    "### 10.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class libraries and object-based programming**\n",
    "- Open-source library classes are more likely to be thoroughly tested, bug free, performance tuned and portable across a wide range of devices, operating systems, and Python bersions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating your own custom classes**\n",
    "- Classes are new data types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance**\n",
    "- New classes can be formed through inheritance and composition from classes in abudant class libraries\n",
    "- When creating a new class, instead of writing all new code, you can designate that the new class is to be formed initially by inheriting the attributes (variables) and methods (the class version of functions) of a previously defined base class (also called a superclass)\n",
    "- The new class is called a derived class (subclass)\n",
    "- To minimize the customization effort, you should always try to inherit from the base class that's clasest to your needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism**\n",
    "- Polymorphism enables you to program \"in the general\" rather than \"in the specific\"\n",
    "- You send the same method call to objects possibly of many different types. Each object responds by \"doing the right thing.\"\n",
    "- The same method call takes on many forms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Classes**\n",
    "- Python 3.7's new data classes help you build classes faster by using a more concise notation and by autogenerating portions of the classes"
